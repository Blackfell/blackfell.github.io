# Me!

My name is Sam, I'm a security engineer for money, but I'm writing here because I enjoy hobbying and playing with technology. 

I am a father to a young family and enjoy Thai boxing, walking, climbing and skiing. I am regularly working on ‘analog’ projects and enjoy woodwork, DIY and am currently creating a home campervan conversion. 

## What can I do for you?

### Consulting
As well as my day job as a Security Analyst, I am a partner with [Threatserve LLP](https://www.threatserve.co.uk/); we offer security services to businesses in the North West of England, but can also provide value 'over the wire' if that's not where you're based. If you think this is something we can help you with, please feel free to get in touch directly with Threatserve, or contact me via any social means on this page if you prefer.

### Mentoring
I mentor people moving into the field of Information Security both formally and informally and take great pleasure in helping others learn and understand technical concepts. This site is designed to help with that to a degree and I'm always happy to add more or different content, or provide individual support if appropriate; if you're thinking about this, why not get in touch?

### Speaking and Communication
I also enjoy speaking on security and am a firm believer that security concepts and technology shouldn't be fenced off from non-technical people; all problems in technology are simple, if you look at them from the right perspective. I take great pleasure in teachning and comjunicating security issues at all levels; if this is somethign I can help you with, why not get in touch?

### Blog posts

I hope that you find some useful content in these pages, so if you have any comments or feedback, be sure to follow the social links and let me know!

### Something I haven't thought of

Imagine the greatest genious that ever has or will be, they are human, and therefore limited; they will not, for example, be able to tell you something that would never have ocurred to them. I am far from perfect, so I'm sure there are things I could help people with that I haven't thought of; if you know what it is, please, tell me.

## Why am I here?

I have worked in the security industry for the last three years, as an offshoot of my early career in Engineering for a large UK integrator. I studied Physics to Masters level in England and have been on a personal learning journey in InfoSec since I started to pick up computing and Linux classes during my degree.

Since then I've completed the [SANS](https://www.sans.edu) GICSP and GPEN certifications, but equally importantly, have kept up a solid tempo in personal projects, hacking exercises and competitions, and programming and making tasks. I've been working on these projects on my own and have now decided to publicly share as much content as I can to help others, particularly those I know that are moving up into the field.

## But I'm not a robot. Honest.

Having said all that, I'm not all computers! I grew up interested in 'analogue' technology, I played with cars and motorbikes and picked up a passion for making things with wood & metal. 

I practiced martial arts throughout university and kept up a Muay Thai practice alongside my work, but I also enjoy mountain sports, climbing, walking and mountain biking. Living in the North West of England lets me stay close to mountain areas and more importantly enjoy time with family. 

I worked with youth throughout my University years and for the first years of my career, both as a [STEM embassador](https://www.stem.org.uk/stem-ambassadors) and as a volunteer with the [Air Cadet Organisation](https://www.raf.mod.uk/aircadets/) in the UK. I have now drawn these activities to a close as I have my own youth organisation (see below!), but take my passion for education and development into my career, mentees, friends and, well, anyone that will listen.

I'm now a father to a young family and take care to enjoy and be mindful of the pleasures of simple family life; swinging an axe and building a house can feel like a far cry from working with computers at time, but sometimes one can help build ideas and enthusiasm for the other.

So please enjoy the site and remember to always **be excellent to each other**.
