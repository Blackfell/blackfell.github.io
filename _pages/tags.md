# Why have tags?

In the sections below, you can browse all articles by tags attached to those posts; this may help if you have a specific interest. Perhaps you care about a certain operating system or programming language, perhaps you want to learn about securing your online accounts. Hopefully this page will help you find that content, the posts themselves are all listed out below.

As always, if you're struggling to find anything, get in touch with me via any of the included social links and I'll help out personally.
