# Why do I blog?

I’ve collected my own notes and resources for years relating to security, coding, computers and business; these lay in various locations and I often needed to find them for new starts at work, or friends just looking for advice, maybe even just for me when I forget something.

My notes are little use in isolation and when last I looked to reorganise them, I knew it was finally time to make them public in the hope that they can help people like you!

## What do I write about?

I’ve been reading blogs around the industry for years and have decided to join the party. I want this to be useful though, so you’ll see walkthroughs, guides, advice, and (hopefully) some guest posts from my firends aroudn the industry.

This content will sometimes be helpful for regular folk's personal security, sometimes for other security professionals, or perhaps they'll just be general discussions into the ether. Who knows what the future will hold? At the end of the day, I want to give you' the reader, value, so if you have thoughts, requests or (hopefully not!) complaints, get in touch via any o fthe social links on this page adn let me know!

## What makes you qualified for this?

Why nothing, of course! That said, this is my hobby and passion, I live security and often bring another point of view to disussions, so why not try some content and see what I’m about?


# Finding Articles
The simplest way to find specific content is to simply search, just press the search icon in the top right of the page and start typing. Easy!

Alternatively, there are a few clever ways to **browse blog content**:
